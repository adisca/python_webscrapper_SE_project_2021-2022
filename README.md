# Python webscrapper

Webscrapper with Selenium and BeautifulSoup that collects the prices of cryptocurency pairs from other sites and displays them in real time in a Javascript frontend using Plotly for drawing plots. More in the documentation.

Since I made the project, the links and page layout of the sites have changed, so it dosen't work without an update, but it still works as a good example.
